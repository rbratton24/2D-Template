# 2D-Template
# 2D Template for platformer created in unity for easier game development

This is a template I have been created when I get time around working, sleep, and kids. I plan on using it on games i plan to create 
in the future. Im not good at keep changes up to date but there are a few features I have created so far

# Moving Platforms
my plan is to just attack the script to a sprite and it applies the components needed.

# GameStates
pause, play, dead, main menu still a WIP

# Player
This will always be a WIP it feels like

# Dialog 
WIP with panels and collision
